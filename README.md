## üè° Canadian Housing Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices across Canadian cities using machine learning (XGBoost).

### ‚úÖ Main Steps:
- Cleaned and preprocessed a Canadian housing dataset from Kaggle by fixing location mismatches, handling missing values, and applying log transformation to price.
- Trained an XGBoost regression model with Hyperopt-based hyperparameter tuning and 5-fold cross-validation; achieved an R¬≤ score of 0.70 on both train and test sets.
- Explained model behavior using SHAP values, permutation importance, and PDP plots, and built an interactive dashboard with Plotly to explore housing trends across cities and provinces.
